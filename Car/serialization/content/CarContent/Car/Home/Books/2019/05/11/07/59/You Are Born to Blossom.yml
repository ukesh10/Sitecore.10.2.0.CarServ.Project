      Hint: Summary
      Value: |
        You Are Born To Blossom co-authored by Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam and Arun Tiwari. The book depicts the visualization of Dr. Kalam about Information and Communication Technology and the hidden rural India talent. In the book, Dr. Kalam depicts his vision of schools in India as of 2020 as “connecting nerve centres” linking teachers, students and community, epitomizing knowledge prevalent around the globe. He invites people to speed up the course social revolution.
        
        This transformation would require elevating the standards of supremacy and thereby preserving the sanctity of public institutions. The book uses the simile of a tree to define the process of knowledge abiding fruits of affluence in the modern globalised world. The book gives references of appropriate contributions made by a large chunk of Indian scientists and artists from where it is evidenced that there is no age bar to ‘blossom’.
        
        He backs designing of such an environment which favours growth and development of several individualistic talents in the country and invites for setting up a scientific state of mind that is channeled by conscience, agreement and by actions that take into account various social and moral ethics towards constructing our own structures.
