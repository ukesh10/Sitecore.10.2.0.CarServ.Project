      Hint: Summary
      Value: "The Professional is someone who possesses the skills and knowledge necessary to do a job-whether it's a top degree from a prestigious university or simply years of on-the-job training. For centuries, we have relied on this definition to help us determine who is capable and who is not, often assuming that the person with the most professional characteristics is the best one for the job. The Professional outlines the explicit and implicit code of conduct. The Professional is a must read for anyone looking for a little clarity in an increasingly blurry world."
