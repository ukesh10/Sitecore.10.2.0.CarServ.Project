        How can an art expert differentiate between a fake and an original piece of art within seconds? How can a marriage analyst know within minutes whether the couple will stay together or not? Some ideas like this and much more gain a true resolution in Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Gladwell.
        
        The best selling author dissects and discusses the art of human intuition and elaborates on how humans can, by developing it to perfection, be able to make quick yet accurate and effective decisions. Termed as ‘snap judgements’ in the book, the author elaborates by using situations how ‘snap judgements’ can be more efficient than reasoned ones, which borders on deliberation.
        
        However, the book is not just an analysis of ‘snap judgement’; rather the book elaborates its usage in situations that happen on a daily basis for enabling a quick attention to the finer details from among a host of variables.
