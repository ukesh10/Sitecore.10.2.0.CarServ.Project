      Value: |
        Can you think of a single moment in the whole day when your mind is blank and thoughtless?
        Do you know how powerful every thought is?
        “Cherish your visions; cherish your ideals; cherish the music that stirs in your heart, the beauty that forms in your mind, the loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts, for out of them will grow all delightful conditions, all heavenly environment; of these, if you but remain true to them, your world will at last be built.”
        Giving an insight into the power of thoughts; the effect they have on our health, body and circumstances; and how we become what we think; this compelling literary essay by James Allen contains practical wisdom which will inspire, enlighten and help us discover our hidden powers.Written in a spiritual tone, As a Man Thinketh has been a valuable source of inspiration ever since its first publication in 1903. It continues to remain a classic bestseller.
