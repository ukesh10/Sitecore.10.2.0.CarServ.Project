        If public speaking frightens you and you’re gripped by anxiety when asked to stand up and speak, then this book is right for you! It holds the key to fight away your fears.
        “Is there the faintest shadow of a reason 
        why you should not be able to think as well 
        in a perpendicular position before an 
        audience as you can when sitting down? 
        Surely you know there is not.”

        With timeless techniques that will help you overcome your fear and valuable insights on how famous speakers prepared their addresses, Dale Carnegie’s How to Develop Self-Confidence and Influence People by Public Speaking continues to help people speak confidently, effectively and efficiently.
